# Hello, I’m Paul! 👋

*Are we new colleagues? Here’s what you probably can expect.*

> Caveat: I’m mindful of my flaws, and this document doesn’t attempt to excuse them. It also [isn’t an attempt to build trust](https://medium.com/@skamille/i-hate-manager-readmes-20a0dd9a70d0). Genuine trust evolves as we work together. Finally, it isn’t comprehensive; just a starting point.

## About Me
* Since June 6, 2022, I’ve worked on Dayforce Wallet as a Mobile Development Manager.
* On [TeamRelate](https://www.farmcredit.info/HRIS/Dayforce/docs/TeamRelateDayforce.pdf), my communications style is “Encourager-Tracker,” and my core conviction is “Discipline-Ambition.”
* On the [Meyers-Briggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers–Briggs_Type_Indicator), I’m a solid [ENFP](https://www.truity.com/personality-type/ENFP).
* These links offer some other tidbits about me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pkadams67) |

## My Responsibilities

* Attract and retain world-class talent
* Set context and priority
* Remove blockers
* Advocate for the team with the rest of the company
* Be open to feedback
* Get to know the team and learn how each member best communicates
* Help guide process to remove friction
* Host one-on-ones with direct reports
    * We should talk regularly—weekly or biweekly.
    * You set the agenda. What would you like to talk about? What’s going well? What’s bugging you?
    * These needn’t be status updates unless discussing project statuses is your desire.
    * I like [this format](https://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions) for our first few one-on-ones.

## Our Keys to Success

* **Be pragmatic**—What works for our team? People > Process. True [Agile](https://agilemanifesto.org/)!
* **Overcommunicate**—[No going dark](https://blog.codinghorror.com/dont-go-dark/). It’s okay to say things more than once. Written communication helps solidify our thoughts (see https://basecamp.com/guides/how-we-communicate items 6 and 7).
* **[Dig yourself (and others) a pit of success](https://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success)**.
* **Continuous improvement**—Little by little, let’s make things better.
* **Process is good**—When it’s just enough to ease the pain and no more.
* **When it comes to _human interaction_, boring is bad**—Emojis and gifs are a terrific way to communicate. Please give cool names to projects.
* **For _technology_, however, [boring](https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology) [is](https://boringrails.com/) [good](http://boringtechnology.club)**.
* We [aren’t](https://blog.codinghorror.com/can-your-team-pass-the-elevator-test/) paid to **write code**. We get paid to **[solve problems](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/the-problem-you-solve-is-more-important-than-the-code-you-write-d0e5493132c6)**, and [sometimes](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-best-code-is-no-code-at-all) that means coding.
* **Data**—Let’s establish some [OKRs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR) and start collecting data. Trends! Cool graphs! How do we measure what we care about?
* [If it matters enough to be careful, it matters enough to build a system around it.](https://seths.blog/2018/11/quality-and-effort/)
* **Don’t be a hero**—[Problem Prevention > Problem Solving](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1218724150312751104). Planning and [pre-mortems](https://hbr.org/2007/09/performing-a-project-premortem) rock!
* **Be assertive** (not passive-aggressive or plain old aggressive). Tact and open communication go a long way.
